 * ============================================================================
 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The Items & Equips Core makes improvements to the RPG Maker MZ item and
 * equipment dedicated scenes (including the shop) and how they're handled.
 * From more item categories, better parameter control, rulings, and more, game
 * devs are able to take control over key aspects of their game's items.
 *
 * Features include all (but not limited to) the following:
 *
 * * Modifying the appearances to the Item Scene, Equip Scene, and Shop Scene.
 * * Categorizing items in unique and multiple categories.
 * * Item Scene and Shop Scene will now display detailed information on items.
 * * NEW! marker can be displayed over recently acquired items in-game.
 * * Equipment notetags to adjust parameters past the editor limitations.
 * * Equipment Rulings to adjust what slot types can and can't be unequipped
 *   and/or optimized.
 * * Equipment Type Handling offers more control over equipment loadouts.
 * * Items sold in shops can be hidden/shown based on Switches.
 * * Items sold in shops can have varying prices adjusted by notetags.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Requirements
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin is made for RPG Maker MZ. This will not work in other iterations
 * of RPG Maker.
 *
 * ------ Tier 1 ------
 *
 * This plugin is a Tier 1 plugin. Place it under other plugins of lower tier
 * value on your Plugin Manager list (ie: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). This is to ensure
 * that your plugins will have the best compatibility with the rest of the
 * VisuStella MZ library.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Major Changes: New Hard-Coded Features
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin adds some new hard-coded features to RPG Maker MZ's functions.
 * The following is a list of them.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Equipment Type Handling
 *
 * - Characters will no longer have one universal equipment slot setting.
 * Classes can have different equipment type loadouts, made possible through
 * the usage of notetags. Also, equipment types of matching names would be
 * treated as the same type, where previously, they would be different types.
 * This means if you have two "Accessory" slots, be it in the form of notetags
 * or through the Database > Types tab, they can both equip the same type of
 * accessories.
 *
 * - The Change Equip event command is now updated to reflect this new change.
 * When processing an equip change, the slot changed will go to the first
 * empty slot of matching type. If all of the actor's matching slot types are
 * equipped, then the equip will replace the last slot available.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Shop Status Window
 *
 * - The Status Window found in the Shop Scene was originally barren and did
 * not display much information at all. This is changed through this plugin's
 * new features. While the contents of the Shop Status Window can be customized
 * through the Plugin Parameters, it is a change that cannot be reversed and
 * for the better since it gives players the much needed information revolving
 * around the game's items.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Core Engine Compatibility: Modern Controls
 *
 * - If the VisuStella Core Engine is added to your game with Modern Controls
 * enabled, then the Item Menu Scene, Equip Menu Scene, and Shop Menu Scene's
 * controls will be changed a bit.
 *
 * - The Item Menu Scene will automatically have the Item List Window active,
 * with using the Left/Right (for single column) or Page Up/Page Down (for
 * multi-columns) to navigate between the Item Categories. Similar will occur
 * when trying to sell items in the Shop Menu Scene.
 *
 * - The Equip Menu Scene will automatically have the Equip Slots Window active
 * and only activate the command window upon moving up to it.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * VisuStella MZ Compatibility
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * While this plugin is compatible with the majority of the VisuStella MZ
 * plugin library, it is not compatible with specific plugins or specific
 * features. This section will highlight the main plugins/features that will
 * not be compatible with this plugin or put focus on how the make certain
 * features compatible.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * VisuMZ_1_BattleCore
 * 
 * Changing the "Damage Multiplier" or "Healing Multiplier" vocabulary for the
 * Item and Equip Core's Shop Status Window is not done with the Item and Equip
 * Core's Plugin Parameters if you have the Battle Core installed.
 * 
 * Instead, go to Battle Core's Plugin Parameters, Damage Settings, Damage
 * Styles, and adjust the style's version of the "Damage Multiplier" or
 * "Healing Multiplier" text instead.
 * 
 * Why does this work this way? Because not all damage styles work off
 * "Multipliers" so in order for it to convey the proper message to the player,
 * each damage style has its own vocabulary to be more accurate.
 * 
 * In case you forget about that, when you visit the Item and Equip Core's
 * plugin parameters for these, it should also remind you in the parameter's
 * description on where to change it.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * VisuMZ_2_WeaponSwapSystem
 *
 * The custom equip slots feature from the VisuStella MZ Items and Equips Core
 * allowed you to add in extra weapon slots. This is now curated up to a max
 * of one weapon slot per character. This needs to be done to make the Weapon
 * Swap System viable.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Notetags
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The following are notetags that have been added through this plugin. These
 * notetags will not work with your game if this plugin is OFF or not present.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * === General ===

 * 
 * ---
 *
 * === Item Accessibility Notetags ===
 *
 * The following notetags allow you to choose when items can/cannot be used
 * based on switches.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <Enable Switch: x>
 *
 * <Enable All Switches: x,x,x>
 * <Enable Any Switches: x,x,x>
 *
 * - Used for: Item Notetags
 * - Determines the enabled status of the item based on switches.
 * - Replace 'x' with the switch ID to determine the item's enabled status.
 * - If 'All' notetag variant is used, item will be disabled until all
 *   switches are ON. Then, it would be enabled.
 * - If 'Any' notetag variant is used, item will be enabled if any of the
 *   switches are ON. Otherwise, it would be disabled.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <Disable Switch: x>
 *
 * <Disable All Switches: x,x,x>
 * <Disable Any Switches: x,x,x>
 *
 * - Used for: Item Notetags
 * - Determines the enabled status of the item based on switches.
 * - Replace 'x' with the switch ID to determine the item's enabled status.
 * - If 'All' notetag variant is used, item will be enabled until all switches
 *   are ON. Then, it would be disabled.
 * - If 'Any' notetag variant is used, item will be disabled if any of the
 *   switches are ON. Otherwise, it would be enabled.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * === JavaScript Notetags: Item Accessibility ===
 *
 * The following are notetags made for users with JavaScript knowledge to
 * determine if an item can be accessible by code.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <JS Item Enable>
 *  code
 *  code
 *  enabled = code;
 * </JS Item Enable>
 *
 * - Used for: Item Notetags
 * - Determines the enabled status of the item based on JavaScript code.
 * - If the actor this is disabled for is the only party member, it will not be
 *   visible in the item list unless the VisuStella Battle Core is installed.
 *   - If the VisuStella Battle Core is installed, then all battle scope items
 *     will be visible even if they're disabled.
 * - Replace 'code' to determine the type enabled status of the item.
 * - The 'enabled' variable returns a boolean (true/false) to determine if the
 *   item will be enabled or not.
 * - The 'user' variable refers to the user with the item.
 * - The 'item' variable refers to the item being checked.
 * - All other item conditions must be met in order for this to code to count.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * === Equipment Notetags ===
 *
 * The following notetags provide equipment-related effects from deciding what
 * equip slots can be given to classes to the base parameter changes asigned
 * to weapons and armors.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <Equip Slots>
 *  slotName
 *  slotName
 *  slotName
 * </Equip Slots>
 *
 * - Used for: Class Notetags
 * - Changes the equipment slot loadout for any actor who is that class.
 * - Replace 'slotName' with an Equipment Type name from Database > Types.
 *   This is case-sensitive.
 * - Insert or remove as many "slotName" equipment types as needed.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <param: +x>
 * <param: -x>
 *
 * - Used for: Weapon, Armor Notetags
 * - Changes the base parameter value for the equip item.
 * - Replace 'param' with any of the following: 'MaxHP', 'MaxMP', 'ATK', 'DEF',
 *   'MAT', 'MDF', 'AGI', or 'LUK' to change that specific parameter's value.
 *   - These notetags do NOT work with X Parameters, S Parameters, or any
 *     custom parameters. These notetags ONLY work with the base parameters.
 * - Replace 'x' with a number value to set the parameter value to.
 * - This allows you to bypass the Database Editor's number limitations.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * <Equip Copy Limit: x>
 * 
 * - Used for: Weapon, Armor Notetags
 * - Sets a maximum number of copies that the actor can wear of this equipment.
 * - Replace 'x' with a number value to determine the copy limit.
 * - This can be bypassed using Event Commands and/or Script Calls.
 * - Usage Example: Actors can only equip one copy of the "One-of-a-Kind Ring"
 *   on at any time despite having empty accessory slots because the ring has a
 *   <Equip Copy Limit: 1> notetag.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Equip Weapon Type Limit: x>
 * 
 * - Used for: Weapon
 * - This weapon cannot be equipped with other weapons of the same type once
 *   the limited amount has been reached.
 * - Replace 'x' with a number value to determine the weapon type limit.
 * - This can be bypassed using Event Commands and/or Script Calls.
 * - Usage Example: A dualwielding warrior who can only equip one sword and a
 *   dagger but never two swords or two daggers because the swords and daggers
 *   all have the <Equip Weapon Type Limit: 1> notetags on them.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Equip Armor Type Limit: x>
 * 
 * - Used for: Armor
 * - This armor cannot be equipped with other armors of the same type once the
 *   limited amount has been reached.
 * - Replace 'x' with a number value to determine the armor type limit.
 * - This can be bypassed using Event Commands and/or Script Calls.
 * - Usage Example: People cannot equip more than two glove accessories on at a
 *   time because the glove is a "Glove" armor-type and each glove item has the
 *   <Equip Armor Type Limit: 2> notetags on them.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Party Artifact>
 * <Troop Artifact>
 * 
 * <Stackable Party Artifact>
 * <Stackable Troop Artifact>
 * 
 * - Used for: Armor
 * - This armor cannot be equipped at all. However, by simply being in the
 *   party's inventory, its parameter bonuses and traits will be applied
 *   globally throughout the whole party or troop (depending on the notetag).
 * - Add both notetags to affect both groups.
 * - The normal versions of the notetag is only applied once regardless of the
 *   number of copies are found in the party's inventory.
 * - The stackable versions of the notetag will have the bonuses and traits
 *   stacked multiple times relative to the number of copies found in the
 *   party's inventory.
 * - This item will NOT be added during the setup phase for Battle Tests.
 *   - If you want to add the item, do it manually.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Equip For Class Only: x>
 * <Equip For Classes Only: x, x, x>
 * <Equip For Class Only: name>
 * <Equip For Classes Only: name, name, name>
 * 
 * - Used for: Weapon, Armor Notetags
 * - This piece of equipment can only be worn by members with 'x' as the main
 *   class. If there are multiple classes listed, at least one of them need to
 *   be the actor's main class.
 * - Replace 'x' with a number representing the ID of the class required.
 * - For the 'name' variant, replace 'name' with the name of the required class
 *   the actor needs to have in order to equip this object.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Equip Requirements>
 *  requirement
 *  requirement
 *  requirement
 * </Equip Requirements>
 * 
 * - Used for: Weapon, Armor Notetags
 * - Defines a requirement(s) for the actor to meet in order for the equip item
 *   to be equippable.
 * - Failure to meet these requirements will cause the equipment to unequip
 *   automatically.
 *   - Keep in mind that in some cases, this will not happen immediately.
 *     Things like switches will require the actor to meet its cache clear
 *     in order to trigger the automatic unequip.
 *   - Some ways to trigger a cache clear would be to change the actor's HP/MP,
 *     or adding and then removing a state for the actor (preferrably an unused
 *     state that has no real effect).
 * - Replace 'requirement' with one of the settings bellow:
 * - Add multiple 'requirement' lines for more requirements.
 * 
 *   Requirements:
 *
 *   param > x
 *   param >= x
 *   param === x
 *   param <= x
 *   param < x
 *   - Replace 'param' with 'level', 'maxhp', 'maxmp', 'atk', 'def', 'mat',
 *     'mdf', 'agi', or 'luk'.
 *   - This will make the piece of equipment require the actor's base parameter
 *     to be greater than (>), greater than or equal to (>=), equal to (===),
 *     less than or equal to (<=), or less than (<).
 *   - This is NOT the value for the total parameter, only the base parameter.
 *   - The base parameter is calculated by the user's class parameter value and
 *     any bonuses received through permanent stat increases.
 *
 *   learned skill: x
 *   learned skill: name
 *   - This will make the piece of equipment require the actor to have learned
 *     skill 'x'. 
 *   - If 'name' is used, priority will be given to the skill with the highest
 *     ID in the database.
 *   - The actor needs to have LEARNED the skill. This means that if you have
 *     added a skill to the actor's kit through a trait, it will not count.
 *
 *   switch: x
 *   - This will require switch X to be on.
 *   - If it isn't, the piece of equipment cannot be worn.
 *   - Insert multiple of these to add more switches that are are required to
 *     be on.
 * 
 *   ***NOTE 1***
 *   There is no "class: x" for these equip requirements. Instead, use the
 *   <Equip For Class Only: x> notetags.
 * 
 *   ***NOTE 2***
 *   For those wondering where "unique only" is, that does not exist in this
 *   plugin. Instead, use the <Equip Copy Limit: x> notetag listed above.
 * 
 *   Example A:
 * 
 *     <Equip Requirements>
 *     level >= 20
 *     </Equip Requirements>
 * 
 *     - Requires the user to be at least level 20 in order to equip.
 * 
 *   Example B:
 * 
 *     <Equip Requirements>
 *     atk >= 50
 *     def <= 50
 *     </Equip Requirements>
 *     - Requires the user have at least 50 base ATK to equip.
 *     - Requires the user to be under 50 base DEF to equip.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Added EType: x>
 * <Added ETypes: x, x, x>
 * 
 * - Used for: Armor Notetags
 * - This is for armors only and does NOT work with weapons!
 * - Allows a piece of armor to belong to multiple ETypes. This means a glove
 *   can be equipped as "Armgear" or as an "Accessory" if you so choose.
 * - Replace 'x' with a number representing the ID of the EType you wish to add
 *   to the list of ETypes.
 *   - Insert multiple 'x' entries to add more than one EType ID.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Cursed>
 * 
 * - Used for: Weapon, Armor Notetags
 * - If this weapon or armor is equipped, it cannot manually be removed by the
 *   player until it is purified.
 * - To remove it, it must be done by event commands, script calls, or through
 *   the Purify-related Plugin Commands provided by this plugin.
 * - Once purified, the weapon or armor will become unequipped unless it has a
 *   purify transformation.
 *   - If the newly transformed weapon/armor is equippable, it will remain in
 *     the actor's equipment slots.
 * - If you are using VisuMZ_2_WeaponSwapSystem, weapons cannot become cursed
 *   in order to allow free weapon swapping. Weaponry will not be cursed
 *   if VisuMZ_2_WeaponSwapSystem is installed.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Purify Transform: id>
 * <Purify Transform: name>
 * 
 * - Used for: Weapon, Armor Notetags
 * - If this notetag is present on a <Cursed> weapon or armor, then upon the
 *   actor receiving purification, the weapon or armor will transform into a
 *   different item.
 * - Replace 'id' with a number representing the transformed weapon/armor's ID.
 * - Replace 'name' with text representing the transformed weapon/armor's name.
 * - Weapons can only transform into weapons.
 * - Armors can only transform into armors.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * === JavaScript Notetags: Equipment ===
 *
 * The following are notetags made for users with JavaScript knowledge to
 * adjust the parameter through code.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <JS Parameters>
 *  MaxHP = code;
 *  MaxMP = code;
 *  ATK = code;
 *  DEF = code;
 *  MAT = code;
 *  MDF = code;
 *  AGI = code;
 *  LUK = code;
 * </JS Parameters>
 *
 * - Used for: Weapon, Armor Notetags
 * - Uses JavaScript to determine the values for the basic parameters based on
 *   the code used to calculate its value.
 * - The variables 'MaxHP', 'MaxMP', 'ATK', 'DEF', 'MAT', 'MDF', 'AGI', and
 *   'LUK' are used to determine the finalized value of the parameter. This
 *   variable is case sensitive.
 * - If a parameter is not present, its value will be treated as +0.
 * 
 * '''WARNING!''' If you are trying to calculate a value based off a full
 * parameter value, such as "ATK = user.atk * 0.10", it's going to break and
 * will cause an infinite loop. Use base parameter values instead.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * === Status Window Notetags ===
 *
 * The following notetags will affect the Shop Status Window info. If for any
 * reason the data that is displayed is not to your liking or insufficient,

 * ** Added: NOTE: Regarding Damage Labels
 * *** If Visu_1_BattleCore is installed, priority goes to its Damage Style
 *   settings. The label displayed is based on the damage style settings in
 *   place for that specific skill or item.
 * *** Go to Battle Core > Plugin Parameters > Damage Settings > Style List >
 *   pick the damage style you want to edit > Damage Label and change the
 *   text settings you'd like there.
 * *** Documentation update added by Yanfly.
 * 
 * Version 1.01: August 23, 2020
 * * Added failsafe to prevent non-existent equipment (because the database
 *   entries have been deleted) from being equipped as initial equipment.
 *   Fix made by Olivia.
 *
 * Version 1.00: August 20, 2020
 * * Finished Plugin!
