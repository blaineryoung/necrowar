where the bosses act as summons in battle
and you can also feed them souls to make the summon stronger
or they are like the crystals from what is it ff3 or 5
where once you get pacted to the boss it unlocks a new class type based on that boss
so like beat dracula your melee fighter can become somekinda blood berserker
while your caster becomes a blood mage

Yeah, so the grand soul is like the base class.  Can only change outside of combat but doesn't get consumed
Regular souls are like the subclass + elemental shift.  Can change in combat but are consumed
